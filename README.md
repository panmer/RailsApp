### Ruby on Rails application


#### Running Commands
```sh
rails new . --skip-git  # already had .git
```

#### Note

- Like Python, Ruby need proper version management. The Gemfile also specified Gem and targeted ruby version, make sure to use the right one.
- Ruby on Rails uses sqlite3 as its default database, which works great in many cases
